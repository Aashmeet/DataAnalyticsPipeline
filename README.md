# DataAnalyticsPipeline
Dev days lab for data analytics via Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction:
In this lab ,we are focussed on data analysis using a Data Pipeline .  

For building an effective data analytics pipeline , it is important to focus on the following :
1. Help ingest data easily from multiple sources.
2. Analyze it for completeness and accuracy.
3. Use it for metrics computations.
4. Store the data assets and scale as they grow rapidly without causing disruptions.
5. Adapt to changes as they happen.
6. Have a relatively short development cycle that is repeatable and easy to implement.
